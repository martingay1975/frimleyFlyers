Happy New Year to all the Flyers. 

We'd like to open entries for the FF League 2026. We are keeping everything the same. Same format, same start and end dates, scoring, etc. Anyone is free to enter.... if you have any friends who you think might enjoy the challenge then they are more than welcome to join us. Here is a short YouTube video explaining the scoring [made a year or two back] - https://youtu.be/GHsAjwweZns - Let me know if you need any clarification.

We are keeping the cost the same. £10 for adults and free for children. This is to help with the general running costs of the Flyers. - Bank details are: 
Sort Code: 77-72-67   Acc No: 02994560

If you can DM me your interest - I've attached a list of some of your quickest 2025 PR times, which will serve as a basis for points scoring. First league event is January 31st - 3.5 weeks away. 

I hope you can join in the fun.🏃‍♀️🏃
