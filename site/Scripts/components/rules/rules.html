				<span>Scoring per series: Some races have a series of events, e.g. Yateley. Your best time out of all the runs completed in the series will be the scoring one.</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				<span>If your best effort is a Pb, then you'll be rewarded an additional </span>

				<span>Scoring overall: Only your best </span> 
				<span data-bind="text: $component.takeNBestScoresObservable"></span>
				<span> scores are taken through out the season and count towards the final league table. This is allows you to potentially miss races without being penalized.</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				<span>Scoring is calculated on % difference from persons PB as at start of the year. e.g. if PB is 2 mins, and complete race in 2 mins 12 secs then that is a 10% difference (12 seconds out of 120 seconds).</span>
			</li>

		        <span>If a person beats their PB during the year then base PB is not changed. Calculations based on the PB time at start of the year.</span>

			<li>
				<span>Times are taken from the official timers (chip / barcode / web site) and not from personal timings.</span>
			</li>

				<span>If you do not have a best time from the past season for a particular distance, then we shall use the <a href="https://www.runnersworld.co.uk/health/rws-race-time-predictor" target="new">Runners World Race Time Predictor</a> to estimate a time.</span>
			</li>
			<li>
				<span>You can join at any point during the season. However, any races missed will NOT be retrospectively recorded. An entry fee of £</span>
