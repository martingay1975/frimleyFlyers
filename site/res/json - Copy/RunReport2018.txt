Farnborough Half
==============
The first event of 2018 somehow ended up with worse conditions than last year. Snow was the enemy today in the first of our Trophy and Championship runs. It didn't seem to affect the Flyers too much.

FF Trophy: www.frimleyflyers.co.uk/fftrophy.html
Just 3 ran the 5km event with Ben Gay taking the honours in a time of 25 minutes dead, despite starting 2 minutes behind everyone else! Karen and our youngest competitor Ashton made their way around in just over 40 minutes. Well done Ashton for braving that weather.

FF Championship: www.frimleyflyers.co.uk/ffchampionship.html
The hotly contested half marathon probably saw the greatest performances! Alasdair Nuttall took full honours smashing almost 20 minutes from his 2017 best performance and attaining an all time pb with a 1:36:33. Oli Peddle and Jo Longmuir also beat their all time PBs. David Peddle, Emma Malcolmlcolm and 2017 Champion, Alan Bush, all improved from their times from last year. Newcomers Alex Longmuir put in solid performance along with Tom and Rich.

Well done to everyone who ran today. If it were down to me, you'd get extra points for running in the snow! Next event for the Trophy is the Frimley Park Hospital 2.5km fun run. The Championship competitors are at the Fleet Half. Remember to book in fast, as places are going quick.

Fleet Half
==============
The delayed Fleet Half was ran on Sunday with some stunning times being performed, in chilly but otherwise good conditions. You had to beat last years time just to score more than a point in this well attended event. Top of the tree again goes to Alasdair Nuttall who recorded a 1:37.23. Alan got a 1:34 and Alex a Flyers record of 1:18.43. In the words of David Coleman, 'truly remarkable'. Special mentions also to Zoe, Alan, Bob and Bruno who all beat their overall Half personal bests'.

So how does that leave the standings after two events. Alasdair has taken a maximum 52 points and takes an early lead. Alan is in second with 41 points having come 2nd and 3rd so far. Paul Williams has finished 4th in both events lies in third position overall.

Hot the on heels is the Frimley Park Hospital 10km next week, along with the 2.5km for the Trophy competitors.

Well done all.

Frimley Park Hospital
==============

Yateley
==============
The first of three in the Yateley series. With the leader being a non runner, the rest of the field can now temporarily at least catch Alasdair up. Mr Alex Halfacre continues to smash records and came 5th overall in the race. A time of 35.25 marks an almost 5% improvement from last years best time. Welcome to the party, Mr James Ball. Having had a difficult few years with many DNS's, James' hard work has paid off with a 44:28 and grabs provistional second place. Paul Williams, David Peddle, Zoe Stone Alex Longmuir all beat their best 2017 10km. Well done all.

There are still two more opportunities to improve positions, so nothing settled yet.


Early July
=================

1)
A little later than usual. The second of the Yateley Series and the First of the July Parkrun series have now been included into the league table standings. At Yateley Alasdair Nuttall again smashed in a superb time of 41:53 taking over 10% off last years best. Alex also PB'ed with a rapid 34:11. Jo Longmuir also clocked in with a quick 42:04.

The first of parkrun July saw Mr Halfacre again obliterate his 2017 time with another impressive 16:32. Welcome to the points Mr Woody with an equally satisfying 25:14. I'm sure he was trying to impress Mrs Woody. Still oppotunities in two events, but provissionally it appears to be a two horse race between Alasdair and Alex. Well done Flyers.

Trophy Report still to come.....


2) 
No change at the top this week, however, underneath we're bubbling away. Jo smashed a PB and the 20 minute barrier to record a 19:42 and 22 points. Meanwhile James also entered a season's best of 20:42. Well done both. An ammendment to last week's timings see's Paul Williams continue to maintain his position in third overall.

We've seen almost everyone improve their times from last week. Em is still leading the way, improving her time by another 15 seconds. Hot on the heels is Kirstie with an excellent 35:01. Alfie came in third, just 23 seconds from his 2017 PB.


1)
The last week has made a difference to the leaderboard. The winner of parkrun July remains to be Mr Alex Halfacre with his opening week's 16:32 PB - 26 points. Jo Longmuir obtains second place with her July 14th run of 19:42 PB - 22 points. Alasdair comes in third with this week's 19:28 PB - 19 points. The only other person to scale up the table due to this weeks's run is Jim Laidlaw with a 20:10.

Overall Alasdair still has a commanding lead. Alex has narrowed it down to 27 points. Paul Williams remains in third with Jo Longmuir jumping up into fourth, displacing Zoe Stone.

Can anyone knock Alasdair off provisional top spot in the Yateley Series? Just one more chance in August. Remember to sign up for Fleet 10km.

2) 
Em Howden again improved her time this week. 4 weeks of parkrun July and each week Em has got quicker. Fantastic effort Em. Kirstie Stone earns second place and Alfred Boese third.

Overall Em Howden extends her lead, whilst Kirstie Stone overtakes Ben Gay into second place having not scored in parkrun July. Both Ashton Peddle and Alfred Boese score points to put pressure on Karen Peddle who is in fourth spot.


Yateley 10km

The final of 3 Yateley races finished last Wednesday with some notable performances. Alex Halfacre smashed home another great run with a 33:36 promoting himself into second spot and 22 points. Jo Longmuir also ran a quick 41:36 to gain third place and 19 points. James Ball, David Peddle, Bob Turner and Jim Laidlaw all turned in their best Yateley performances and gained points.

Overall Alasdair still leads with 2 events to go. Remember the best 5 scores out of the 7 events are recorded. Next stop is Fleet 10km. Get your entries in.

Fleet 5km / 10km
=================
In the Championship, Alasdair Nuttal again smashed it out of the park recording a massive 5 minute improvement, pb'ing at 40:53 and scoring a maximum 26 points. Alex Halfacre ran in second for the whole event with a 34:18, which is a huge achievement in itself as well as bagging 22 points. Fantastic stuff boys. Dave Peddle produced his best performance of the season posting a 44:11, along with the consistent high scorer of Paul Williams. They make up the top 3 for Fleet. Other notable runs were Bruno Silva who broke his PB, Jodie Raynesford and Bob Turner beat their 2017 best 10km times.

Overall we can now crown Alasdair Nuttal as the champion as he has an unassailable lead - a whopping 126 points. Well done Alasdair. Alex is in second and Paul Williams third. The final 'parkrun November' event starts in two weekends time. Good luck.

In the Trophy just 1 runner. The consistently impressive Em Howden recorded a 5 minute improvement with a 29:25. Well done Em, you've blown the competition away.
