Yateley Virtual
====
After our longest break ever we had a good turn out for the impromptu Virtual Yateley 10km. To get into the top 3 you had to smash your 2019 PB with the winners being Rich, Kirstie and Christine. Many congratulations to them for making the FF podium. Outstanding performances from: Jim, Darren, Louise Mc and Hannah. They also beat their 2019 times, each earning their 5 bonus points (because they beat last years times).
We've also had important submissions in the parkrun Tourist event (which lasts all year). Hannah takes the lead in that respect with her 28:22 run at Rushmoor on the 8th Feb.
So all told, Hannah Williams with her two PB performances takes the lead with 37 points, followed by Rich Howden on 26 and Kirstie Stone on 22. 
The next event hopefully is Yateley 10km August. Well done everyone for participating and producing top notch performances.
