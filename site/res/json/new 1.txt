Well done those Flyers who took part in the first of the Yateley 10km Series on Wednesday. Some very nice times indeed. Remember the points can change as there are still 2 events to run (6 Jul, 3 Aug). Woody has provisionally taken top points with a 56:10 (-10.8%). Christine continued her excellent form with a 51:33 (-10.3%) taking 22 points. Fiona completes a Keane-Munday heavy podium in third place with a 1:02:06.

Tourist Parkrun is the other ongoing event. There was no FLP on 14th May, which gave an excuse for all to be a tourist. Many of the FF went to Bushy Park. On that day, Woody, Christine, Susan R, Tom, Rich, Em, Kirstie, Jodie, Fiona, James, Susan H, Jo, Dave, Karen and Andy all improved their 2022 parkrun at various locations. Well done all.
