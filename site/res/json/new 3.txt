Last Sunday was the Great South Run. Event 5 so far this season. The 10 miler saw 6 Flyers take part in the popular run with good conditions. Our leader, Christine pulled out with a recent injury leaving the door open for someone to take advantage. Our very own Mr Stone took a maximum of 26 points with 1h 14m (-4%), followed by Sarah (4%) and Woody (5%). Kirsty, Louise and Jo also completed the course and accumulated points.

Also since last reporting the ongoing parkrun Tourist event continues. Achievements during September and October. Dave Peddle registered an impressive 19:14 at Brooklands, Jo Longmuir a 23:28 at Edenbrook, Martin Gay a 25:56 at Itchen Valley, Rich Hoween a 26:02 at Rushmoor, Sam Benson a 26:56 at Great Salterns and Simon Harvey a 21:51 in Krak√≥w. Well done all.

Overall Christine has a slender lead of Woody, with Mr D Peddle in bronze medal position. Still all to play for. The next event is the Fleet 10km on the 30th October. Entries are still open for this event. https://www.runbritain.com/entries/EnterRace.aspx?evid=7abb0ccd5969&erid=74b80ac15952
