The events are coming thick and fast now. After Darren's 26 pointer at the Great South, he's followed it up with another 26 points at the Fleet 10km last week. Gareth achieved 2nd place with an admirable sub hour run and James achieving a bronze medal run with a 47:12. Well done you 3 for competing in not such nice weather.

Also, parkrun Tourist is now finished. Woody has taken top marks in that particular mini comp with his 25:30 run at Bushy on 14th May. Christine's 24:22 at Edenbrook and James's 19:37 at Hove Promenade complete the top 3 spots.  Special mentions to Loise McIntosh (Victoria Dock), Alasdair Nuttal (Edenbrook) Darren Stone (Southsea), Dave Peddle (Brooklands),  Sarah Campbell-Foster (Broadwater), Fiona Keane-Munday (Bushy), Richard Fyvie (Worthing), Simon Harvey (Krak√≥w), Sam Benson (Great Salterns), Martin Gay (Itchen Valley) and Paul Williams (Brooklands). They all beat their best 2021 parkrun time with their tourist efforts.

So to the overall standings. Darren has now made a two horse race, a three horse race. Christine who is nursing an injury is still top with 96 points, followed by Woody with 86 and now Darren with 82. Just 14 points separate the top 3 as we slide into our last event, FLP November.

So lets have a good turnout at FLP November. Remember we take your best effort from Frimley Lodge parkrun for the next 4 weeks and then count that towards your final score. Good luck, still lots to play for.
