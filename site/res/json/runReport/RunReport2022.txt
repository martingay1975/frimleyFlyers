Run Frimley 10km
Good morning. A quick update on the FF league starting with yesterday's RunFrimley 10km. Some notable performances. Firstly, well done to Christine who has bettered her 2021 time by 4 minutes earning herself 26 points. Mr Dave Peddle not only bettered his time, but achieved his 10km PB coming in at a time of 41:38. Amazing. Jodie took home bronze medal place with a creditable 56:31. 

New to 2022 is the rolling parkrun Tourist event - any non FLP parkrun. Plenty have been running all over the place which is nice to see. Top 3. Woody is currently takes 26 points with his Broadwater effort (19 March), then Lou Mc at Victoria Dock (2 April) and completing the podium is James with a 21:11 at Southsea (16 April).
